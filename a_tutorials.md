# Geant4 Tutorials

We developed a series of tutorials to help you get started with Geant4. 

The lectures cover all aspects of the toolkit of Geant4 version {{ site.latestg4}}, from 
basic installation through advanced topics including multithreading and 
variance reduction options, and is interspersed with hands-on sessions that 
build a progressively more complex application extensible to real use. 

The course should be of interest both to complete novices and to those who already 
have some basic familiarity with Geant4. Participants are expected to have a reasonable 
knowledge of **C++** and **Linux** in addition to basic radiation physics.
