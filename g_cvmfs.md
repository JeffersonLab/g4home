# How to use Geant4 on the JLab CUE machines 

The environment is setup using `module` commands. To enable it:

- tcsh: `source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/jlab/geant4/ceInstall/geant4_cvmfs.csh`
- bash, zsh: `source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/jlab/geant4/ceInstall/geant4_cvmfs.sh`

After sourcing the script, you can use the command `module load sim` to load the latest 
version of Geant4:


```module load sim```
